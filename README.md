## Hi there

I am Jack from Hong Kong and I am a VR game programmmer. I mainly use Unreal Engine and Unity for the projects. I am also trying to develop AR and MR game. 

Currently I have finished two VR games during internship: "FTLife Game of Life" and "SOUL Keeper"

### FTLife Game of Life
It is a multiplayer game using Unreal Engine and the EOC plugin. It includes main game as well as two mingames to simulate the events people will face during their lifetime. The game uses third person perspective for the main game and first person for the minigames. This game allows 1-4 players to participate with one player hosts as server.
